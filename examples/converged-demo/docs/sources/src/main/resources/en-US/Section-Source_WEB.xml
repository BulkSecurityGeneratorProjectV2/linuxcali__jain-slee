<para>
As described in <xref linkend="design_web"/> &THIS.EXAMPLE; web UI is built using the JBoss Seam. 
</para>
<para>
The Seam Framework sits on top of Java EE 5.0 to provide a consistent and easy-to-understand programming model for all components in an enterprise web application. It eliminates most of the boilerplate code and XML configuration from your applications. By solving the integration problem, Seam opens web developers to useful tools that were too hard to integrate into web applications before. For instance, with Seam, it is now trivial to write a web application that is driven by business processes and rules, or to write an AJAX data entry form that is directly validated against database constraints, or to trigger recurring offline events from web applications.
</para>

<para>
In &THIS.EXAMPLE; the various components that seam integrates are EJB3 Beans, JSF and jBPM. The EJB3 is already covered in <xref linkend="source_jpa"/>. For jBPM please refer to <xref linkend="source_jbpm"/>. JSF web pages (look at .xhtml pages in converged-demo/web/war/src/main/webapp) display the user interface. These pages capture user input via forms and display the data. The data fields on the page are mapped to the backend data model via the JSF Expression Language (EL). EJB3 session beans or annotated Seam POJOs that act as UI event handlers for the
JSF web pages. They update the data model based on the user input.
