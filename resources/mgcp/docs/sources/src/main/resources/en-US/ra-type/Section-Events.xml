	<title>Events</title>

	<para>
		Events represent MGCP Requests or Responses received by the MGCP
		stack (incoming requests and responses) and Timer expiry. Each
		MGCP Requests is fired as different event types. Each MGCP
		Response is fired as different event types. Events are fired on
		<literal>MgcpConnectionActivity</literal>
		or
		<literal>MgcpEndpointActivity</literal>
		activities. There are several event types defined. Following is
		the table that describes event-type (name, vendor and version),
		event-class and whether its fired on MgcpConnectionActivity or
		MgcpEndpointActivity or both.
