			<para>The operations done through the JMX Agent are not kept once the server is shutdown. For instance, if a deployable unit is installed through JMX, and the server is shutdown, once the server is started again the deployable unit will not be installed.</para>

			<title>JMX Console</title>
			
			<para>&JEE.PLATFORM; provides a simple web console that gives quick access to all MBeans registred in the server, which includes the ones defined by the JAIN SLEE 1.1 specification.</para>

			<para>To access the JMX console, with the server running, point a web browser to <literal>http://ip:8080/jmx-console</literal>, where <literal>ip</literal> is the IP/Host the container is bound, which is 127.0.0.1/localhost by default.</para>			

			<variablelist>
				<para>MBeans in domain <literal>javax.slee</literal> are all standard JAIN SLEE 1.1 MBeans, while the ones in domain <literal>org.mobicents.slee</literal> are proprietary to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE, the following ones are of particular interest:</para>					
		    	<varlistentry>
				 	<term><literal>org.mobicents.slee:service=MobicentsManagement</literal></term>
				    <listitem>
				       <para>the MBean which can be used to make non persistent changes to the server configuration, in runtime. The operation <literal>dumpContainerState</literal> displays a textual snapshot of the server's state, which can be used to quickly look for memory leaks or other debug/profiling related tasks.</para>
		    	    </listitem>
				</varlistentry>

			   	    <term><literal>org.mobicents.slee:name=DeployerMBean</literal></term>
			        <listitem>				            <para>the MBean allows interaction with the persistent deployable unit deployer. The operation <literal>showStatus</literal> displays a textual snapshot of the deployers's state, which can be used to quickly find out if there is any deployable unit deployment pending, for instance, due to missing dependencies.</para>

				</varlistentry>

			<important><para>For further information about JAIN SLEE 1.1 MBeans and their operations refer to the JAIN SLEE 1.1 Specification, all are covered with great detail.</para></important>

			<title>&MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; Console</title>
			<para>The JMX Console is simple but the MBeans operations were made considering its invocation by management clients, not people using browsers. &MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; was developed to become Red Hat's Middleware Administration Tool, providing an unified interface and extensible model, to be used to control, monitor and manage servers individually, and clusters.</para>
			<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE binary release includes a &MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; Console in <filename>tools/management-console</filename>, with standalone documentation.</para>
