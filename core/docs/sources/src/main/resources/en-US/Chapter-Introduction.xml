	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE</title>

	<para>JAIN SLEE is the specification for a Java Service Logic and Execution Environment (SLEE) architecture, created in the Java Community Process (JCP) by several individuals and companies, including Red Hat. A SLEE is an application server, or service container, which defines a component model for structuring the logic of communications services as a collection of reusable components, and for combining these components into even more sophisticated services. This model was designed and optimized for event-driven applications.</para>
	
	<para>In addition to the service component model, the SLEE also defines management interfaces used to administer the container and the service components executing within, and a set of standard facilities, which provide common features, such as timers, traces and alarms, to JAIN SLEE components.</para>
	
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE is the first and only open source platform certified for JAIN SLEE 1.1 compliance, providing a highly scalable, event-driven application server with a robust component model and a fault tolerant execution environment.</para>

	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> is built on top of the open source award winning &JEE.PLATFORM;, which means that &THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> complements <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> with Java Enterprise (<acronym>JEE</acronym>) 5 container features, allowing strong convergence of different application models, for even feature richer communication services, for instance, the Web and <acronym>SIP</acronym> can be combined to achieve a more sophisticated and natural user experience. &THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> inherits quality management features and tools from &JEE.PLATFORM;, such as the JMX Console, &MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; Plugins and SNMP Adaptor.</para>
