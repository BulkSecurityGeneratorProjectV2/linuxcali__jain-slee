	<title>JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles JPA Mapping</title>
	
	<para>As mentioned in the containers configuration section, &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE uses JPA to store all JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles, and in mentioned section it was explained how to define which JPA / Hibernate data source. In this section more details are provided about how JAIN SLEE 1.1 Profiles are mapped to a JPA datasource schema.</para>

		<title>Profile Specification JPA Tables And columns</title>
    <para>
    For each Profile Specification, at least one <acronym>JPA</acronym> Table is created, and is named <literal>SLEE_PE_</literal> concatenated with the Profile CMP interface simple name (<literal>obtained as java.lang.Class.getSimpleName()</literal>), then <literal>_</literal>, and finally the absolute value of the <literal>hashCode()</literal> method of the javax.slee.ComponentID of the Profile Specification.
    </para>
    <para>
    This table has a primary key composed by the profile name and profile table name, and a column for each attribute of the Profile Specification CMP, except for those of array type. Those columns are named <literal>C</literal>, concatenated with the cmp attribute name.
    </para>	
    <para>
    For each Profile CMP attribute of <parameter>array</parameter> type, a join table is created, and is named <literal>SLEE_PEAAV_</literal> concatenated with the Profile CMP interface simple name (<literal>obtained as java.lang.Class.getSimpleName()</literal>), then <literal>_</literal>, then the absolute value of <literal>hashCode()</literal> method of the javax.slee.ComponentID of the Profile Specification, and finally the CMP attribute name. This table has a generated primary key column named <literal>ID</literal>, the foreign key, and two columns to store the CMP attribute value:

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>SERIALIZABLE</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          Used to store the value if its type does not allow it to be converted to a String.

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>STRING</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          Used when the CMP attribute type can be converted to a <literal>java.lang.String</literal>, for instance an <literal>Integer</literal>.
