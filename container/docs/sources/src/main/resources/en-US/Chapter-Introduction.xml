	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE</title>

	<para>JAIN SLEE is the specification for Java Service Logic and Execution Environment (SLEE) architecture, created in the Java Community Process (JCP) by several individuals and companies like including Red Hat. A SLEE is an application server, or service container. It defines a model for structuring the logic of communications services as a collection of reusable components. These components are combined to form more complex services. The model was designed and optimized for event-driven applications.</para>
	
	<para>In addition to the service component model, the SLEE also defines management interfaces used to administer the container and its underlying services like timers, traces and alarms.</para>
	
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE is the first and only open source platform certified for JAIN SLEE 1.1 compliance. It provides highly scalability, event-driven application server, robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.</para>

	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> is built on top of the open source award winning &JEE.PLATFORM;, which means that &THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> complements <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> with Java Enterprise (<acronym>JEE</acronym>) 5 container.It allows strong convergence of different application models. Communication services like, Web and <acronym>SIP</acronym> can be combined to achieve comprehensive features that will ultimately enhance user experience. &THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>JAIN SLEE</acronym> inherits quality management features and tools from &JEE.PLATFORM;, such as the JMX Console, &MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; Plugins and SNMP Adaptor.</para>

	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE can also be complemented with &THIS.PLATFORM; <acronym>SIP</acronym> Servlets and &THIS.PLATFORM; Media Server. The integration will provide better functionalities that will make the platform stand out from the rest.</para>
