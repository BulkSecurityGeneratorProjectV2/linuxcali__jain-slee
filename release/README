The Mobicents team is glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 
2.5.0.FINAL, codenamed HENDRIX, is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The HENDRIX SLEE Core includes fixes for several issues reported by 
community, some of critical importance, such as rare scenarios where 
an Activity End Event is incorrectly routed while the activity is suspend, 
child Sbb JNDI lookup failures, or state deadlock timeouts when using 
the monitoring for idle activities. Low level parts of the SLEE core had to 
be reworked, for such fixes, the team is confident that not only these 
were well solved, but also that the code is again more stable and efficient. 
Speaking of performance, significant improvements should be expected, 
specially while in cluster mode, due to optimizations introduced.

Regarding SIP, the SIP11 Resource Adaptor now uses JAIN SIP HA 1.3.0 
stack, and introduces some minor fixes. The Mobicents SIP Balancer 
bundled was updated too, to 1.4.0 version. 

With respect to Diameter, HENDRIX bundles the recently released 
Mobicents Diameter 1.4.0.CR1, and with it introduces a couple of new 
Resource Adaptors too: Diameter Gq and Diameter Rx, for a richer IMS 
endpoint support.

With respect to SS7, the release bundles the latest Mobicents SS7 
1.0.0.BETA10, and both MAP and JCC Resource Adaptors were updated 
to ensure compatibility.

This release updates several other Resource Adaptors, most notably it 
introduces a revamped HTTP Client RA, with new Resource Adaptor Type, 
working on top of latest Apache HTTP Client 4.x. It also includes the 
first candidate release of JDBC RA, with a simple, yet very powerful and 
flexible, all new Resource Adaptor Type, which provide means to develop 
the most efficient SLEE application interactions with JDBC Data Sources. 
The SMPP5 RA was also updated, now includes SLEE Usage Parameters, 
which a SLEE administrator may use to monitor its performance or status, 
while the TFTP RA has reached FINAL release status.

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, a new REST Client enabler is 
introduced, which should enable SLEE applications interactions with REST 
web services. A few lines of SLEE code is all that is needed, for an Sbb to 
interact with Twitter, Facebook and other popular web services. The SIP 
Subscription Client now has a simpler to use interface, and supports 
resource lists. The XDM Client, since it depends on SIP Subscription Client, 
was also updated.

Finally, in the Tools department, we are proud to introduce the first 
candidate release of EclipSLEE 2.x, the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Eclipse Plugin. 
This new release completes the initial feature set for this generation of the 
plugin, now with an easy way to integrate the Resource Adaptor 
Types, Application Enablers and Libraries included in Mobicents JAIN SLEE. 
This feature may be configured to include 3rd party components. Besides the
 expected bug fixes, the plugin also includes new menu shortcuts to simplify 
its usage.
 
About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.

A final note, thanks to all Mobicents community members who also helped 
with the making of this release, with reports and/or testing enhancements.
There were two standouts this time, Vilius Panevėžys from Elitnet, and 
Carl-Magnus Björkell from Emblacom, and as recognition for their community 
work (not only with respect to this release), they now are members of the 
Mobicents Core team, congratulations to both.
 
Cheers.
