We are glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.4.0.FINAL, the first stable 
version of SAKURA, is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The JAIN SLEE Core stabilizes the container life-cycle introduced in last release, which 
redefined the startup, shutdown and deployment phases, making it possible to start 
and shutdown a cluster node, in every possible way without introducing any harm 
on the running services. This release introduces additional JAIN SLEE 1.1 extensions, 
ChildRelationExt and SbbLocalObjectExt, which allows a much simpler, and efficient 
application code when working with SBB child relations. Also new is the enhancement of 
the Fault Tolerant RA API, with a Fault Tolerant Timer, which RAs may use to schedule 
tasks that support fail-over.

This release introduces two new Resource Adaptors: the JDBC RA, which provides an efficient 
and asynchronous model to interact with JDBC Datasources, and the TFTP Server RA, which 
enables applications to turn Mobicents JAIN SLEE into a TFTP Server. The TFTP Server RA 
was contributed by Massxess ( http://www.massxess.nl ), an active Mobicents JAIN SLEE 
community partner. 

With respect to SS7, the release bundles the newest Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.BETA8, and updates 
also the related JCC and MAP Resource Adaptors.

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, all were update to take advantage of the JAIN 
SLEE 1.1 extensions, their interfaces were also simplified. All are now released as Candidate 
Release, and should quickly gain FINAL status. Note that the IMS User Profile Enabler was 
renamed to HSS Client, since its functionality is not limited to IMS User Profile data.
 
In the Tools department, we are proud to introduce another milestone of EclipSLEE, the JAIN SLEE 
Eclipse Plugin. This new BETA version includes multiple bug fixes, supports our JAIN SLEE 1.1 
extensions, and now allows editing components/modules after creation.
 
About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
