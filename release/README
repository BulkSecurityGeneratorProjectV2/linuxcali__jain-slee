We are glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.4.0.CR1, codenamed SAKURA 
(a symbol of Japan, a flower which signals the winter end, which, the team 
sincerely hopes, brings better days to such fine country and people), is now 
available for download. It's the second 2011 major release for Mobicents JAIN 
SLEE 2.x, and its for sure another major milestone for the popular open source 
JAIN SLEE platform. SAKURA brings again major enhancements in the JAIN SLEE 1.1 
Core, the bundled Resource Adaptors, enablers, examples, tools, and additional 
Mobicents components, and while it's tagged as a candidate release, thus not 
production quality, we believe that quickly will earn such status.

The SAKURA release also completely changes the game by switching the license 
terms, we are very proud to announce that Mobicents JAIN SLEE, and all the 
bundled Mobicents projects, now use the LGPL 2.1 license, which we believe will 
bring even more community members, and increase third party contributions.

Release Notes:

The JAIN SLEE Core introduces major changes in the container lifecycle, specially 
in the startup, shutdown and deployment phases. It should now be possible to start 
and shutdown a cluster node, in every possible way without introducing any harm 
on the running services. A note of great IMPORTANCE around JAIN SLEE Resource Adaptors, 
it is now required these strictly follow the JAIN SLEE 1.1 specs with respect to 
provided SBB interfaces, which means these must be available in any state of the RA 
lifecycle, including before the raActive() callback is invoked. The file deployer was 
reworked, it should now provide more flexible deployments, such as deployable units 
containing services which depend on RA entities and links to be created. Also, as usual 
several bug fixes were introduced, mostly reported by the community, please refer to 
the issue list below to understand what was fixed.

The SIP RA now supports early dialog failover, which is of particular importance for
B2BUA category applications, and even if that means more data is replicated in the 
cluster, performance was not harmed, it actually improved a bit due to other 
enhancements.

With respect to Diameter, the release bundles the newest Mobicents Diameter 1.4.0.BETA1 
stack, and introduces several optimizations in all Resource Adaptors.

With respect to SS7, the release bundles Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.BETA7, and updates also  
the JCC and MAP Resource Adaptors.

Still in Resource Adaptors topic, the Apache HTTP Client used as the base of the XCAP 
Client RA was upgraded to version 4.1, and performance tuned, and the SMPP v5 RA was 
reworked to fix several issues reported in the community, and should include a good 
performance enhancement too.

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, the XDM Client now includes the functionality 
to subscribe and be notified of changes in XDM Server managed XML documents, and the SIP 
Subscription Client enabler was enhanced too.
 
With respect to bundled example applications, the release now includes the Slee Connectivity 
example, which demos the interaction with the SLEE Container, by a Java EE application, 
colocated or not in the same JVM.

In the Tools department, the Remote SLEE Connection tool is now able to re-establish a broken 
connection with the remote SLEE container, and includes a couple of bug fixes.

As for the EclipSLEE plugin, it finally includes modules to create Resource Adaptor Types and 
Resource Adaptor implementations, now supporting all kinds of SLEE components, and was deeply 
enhanced using the great community feedback. We are now very close, functionality speaking, to 
complete the first phase of the plugin second generation development, which is a plugin used by 
the team to develop all SLEE components, and are now really excited on new features to be added, 
and of course, the community wishes will have a great influence on the definition of these 
features.
 
Finally, note that the whole documentation is now stored in the root docs directory, using a 
structure very similar to how the components are organized in the binary, and note also 
that all jars now include MANIFEST files compatible with OSGI bundling. 

About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
