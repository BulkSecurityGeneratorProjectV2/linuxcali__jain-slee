We are glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.4.1.FINAL, the first SAKURA update, 
is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The JAIN SLEE Core was updated to include fixes for several issues reported by the 
community, including class loading deadlocks, cluster node startup and SBB activity 
context interfaces.

This release updates also several Resource Adaptors: the SIP RA, with some minor logging 
adjustments; the XCAP Client RA, which now includes a different default configuration for 
the underlying Appache HTTP Client, and validates XCAP URI building to ensure usage is 
correct (see javadocs for more details); the JDBC RA, which now only closes the JDBC 
connection once the related event is unreferenced; JCC and MAP RAs, now updated for 
Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.BETA9; the SMPP5 RA, with better support for multi threading message 
sending; and the TFTP Server RA, with just a minor documentation fix, now promoted to 
candidate release status. 

With respect to SS7, the release bundles the latest Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.BETA9.

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, the release includes the second candidate 
release for the XDM Client, which implementation code was optimized.

Finally, in the Tools department, we are proud to introduce another milestone of EclipSLEE, 
the JAIN SLEE Eclipse Plugin. This new BETA version includes multiple bug fixes, the most 
important being the usage of M2Eclipse and Mobicents Eclipse Plugin to build the proper 
classpath of the project, essential for a proper identification of components which may be 
referenced, which should help a lot, for instance when the user wants to add an event for 
specific Resource Adaptor Type.
 
About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
