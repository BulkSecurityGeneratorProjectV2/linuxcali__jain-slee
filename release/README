The Mobicents team is glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 
2.6.0.FINAL, codenamed GANDHI, is now available for download. 

Release Notes:

The GANDHI SLEE Core includes, besides a few bug fixes, enhancements for 
smooth upgrades of SLEE services with zero downtime, and also a core 
deploy-config.xml resource that admins may use to define Resource Adaptor 
Entities out of deployable units. The SLEE core also includes support for 
period purge of canceled timer tasks, introduced in the latest release of 
the Mobicents Cluster framework.

Regarding SIP, the SIP11 Resource Adaptor includes fixes for several bugs 
reported by the community.

With respect to Diameter, GANDHI bundles the recently released Mobicents 
Diameter 1.4.0.CR2, and with it introduces a new Resource Adaptor too: 
Diameter S6a.

With respect to SS7, the release bundles the latest Mobicents SS7 
1.0.0.CR3, and both MAP and JCC Resource Adaptors were updated 
to ensure compatibility.

With respect to media control, GANDHI includes the first BETA release of 
the MS Control (JSR 309) Resource Adaptor, which aims to provide a 
standard high level API to interact with media resources. 

Finally, on Resource Adaptors topic, this release also introduces the 
first FINAL release of JDBC RA, the RA with a simple, yet very powerful 
and flexible, interface for interacting with JDBC Data Sources. 

Regarding the bundled application Enablers, the first candidate release for 
the REST Client enabler is included, while the SIP Publication Client, the 
SIP Subscription Client, and the XDM Client, now reach the first FINAL 
release.

In the Tools department, we are proud to introduce the first 
FINAL release of EclipSLEE 2.x, the Mobicents JAIN SLEE Eclipse Plugin. 
This new release, besides fixing a couple of bugs, enhances the initial 
feature set for this generation of the plugin, now with support for Fault 
Tolerant Resource Adaptors. the Twiddle CLI tool also reached now the first 
FINAL version.

We are also very happy to introduce the new SLEE Management Console, the 
reborn of the old but much missed Mobicents SLEE 1.x GWT web console. The 
interface was refreshed and improved, and supports JAIN SLEE 1.1 
functionality such as Resource Adaptor Entity reconfiguration. Even if 
this is only the first BETA release of the tool, we trust it will be 
popular and very useful. The new console comes pre-deployed in both SLEE 
server profiles, to check it out point your web browser to 
http://serverhost:8080/slee-management-console , where serverhost should be 
replaced by the host that Mobicents SLEE is bound, localhost by default.

Finally, to complete the big change log, the team released two new example 
applications: one is the SIP JDBC Registrar, a rework of the old - and now 
removed - SIP Services example, that demos the usage of the JDBC Resource 
Adaptor, to manage the state of a SIP Registrar server. Note that the Call 
Controller 2 and SIP Wake Up examples were also updated to take advantage 
of this new SIP Registrar. The other new example application is a demo of 
MS Control Resource Adaptor usage, which should be handy for developers 
wanting a quick start on the new media control API.

Note, this release bundles a new and unreleased SNAPSHOT of the Mobicents 
Media Server 2.1.0 BETA5 current trunk source code, that supports JSR 309. 
Due to this there were other updates to media related examples, such as 
the MGCP Demo, but functionality did not change.
 
About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
