The Mobicents team is proud to announce the release of
Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.1.2.FINAL, a minor update to 2.1.1.GA.

This release fixes several issues in the JAIN SLEE Core, 
Resource Adaptors and examples, while updating Resource Adaptor 
stacks at same time. Other Mobicents projects bundled were also 
updated, such as the Media Server, the Diameter stack or the 
SIP Load Balancer. Users of 2.1.1.GA or older releases should update 
to 2.1.2.FINAL as soon as possible, since some issues fixed are of 
critical importance.

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through two different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.

Note that Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x now requires JDK6.

Quick start:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply extract the content of the binary release zip, make sure there
is no JBOSS_HOME environment variable set (or it is pointing to the
jboss-5.1.0.GA directory extracted) and start the container, through
run.sh/run.bat startup scripts in jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin. More information
regarding the JAIN SLEE Container in the documentation available at
the docs directory. Other documentation, regarding other platform
components, is available in the related component's directory (e.g.
the SIP11 Resource Adaptor documentation in is /resources/sip11/docs).

Very Important:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a community project and, as such is not supported with an SLA.
Any questions or problems can be raised through our forums, where we
will provide our best efforts to assist.
This project is included in the JBoss Communications Platform for
which a support subscription is available. Red Hat also provides other
solutions, such as training or consultancy. More at
http://www.redhat.com/solutions/telco

A final note, from now on stable releases will be tagged as FINAL, 
instead of GA, this is just a tag change which has been adopted 
by all JBoss community releases. 

Cheers.
