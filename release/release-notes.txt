We are glad to announce that Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.3.0.FINAL, codenamed 
SUPERSONIC, is now available for download. It's the first 2011 major release 
for Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x, and its for sure a major milestone for the popular 
open source JAIN SLEE platform. Besides major enhancements in the JAIN SLEE 1.1 
Core, the bundled Resource Adaptors, enablers, examples, tools, and additional 
Mobicents components, results in the most feature-packed Mobicents JAIN SLEE 
release ever.  

Release Notes:

The JAIN SLEE Core includes major changes, making it more efficient, with 
respect to memory usage and performance, with or without cluster replication.
The release codename was introduced to mark a milestone, to signal that 2.3 is 
the special release that broke the 1000 calls per second result in the usual SIP 
UAS Load Test, using the old low end server, and this due to the enhancements 
introduced in the JAIN SLEE Core only. Being more concrete on the tests results, 
this means more than 10% performance increase, but we believe that further 
enhancements on upper levels will show that the Core improvements are way more 
expressive. But much more important than the performance enhancements is pure 
raw local mode, the team is proud to announce that, when using a cluster with 
replication, it should be expected performance improvements of at least 50%.

With respect to Diameter, the release bundles Mobicents Diameter 1.3.3.FINAL 
stack, but introduces several optimizations in all Resource Adaptors, which by 
the way, now includes one for the IMS Gx interface.

With respect to SS7, the release bundles Mobicents SS7 1.0.0.BETA6, and updates 
the JCC and MAP Resource Adaptors.

Also, still in Resource Adaptors topic, since the team did not receive any negative 
feedback with respect to the SMPP v5 Resource Adaptor, we decided to promote it to 
FINAL status. 

In last release the XDM Client enabler was introduced, now 2.3 introduces three 
additional enablers: IMS User Profile, SIP Publication Client, SIP Subscription 
Client.

The IMS User Profile enabler allows JAIN SLEE applications to easily 
integrate functionalities related to interactions with a HSS present in an IMS 
network.

The SIP Publication Client enabler provides the functionalities with 
respect to publication of state in a SIP Event Server, such as a Presence Server. 

The SIP Subscription Client enabler provides the functionalities with respect to 
SIP Subscriptions, for instance related also with SIP Presence.

All these enablers allow the Mobicents JAIN SLEE users to keep applications from 
dealing with particular Resource Adaptors and related activities or events, the model 
is always the same, the application requests a feature through a child sbb synchronous 
interface, and it will get a callback with the result. The enablers allows common 
functionality reusage across Mobicents JAIN SLEE users applications, with the best 
implementation possible, all provided by the Mobicents team and community.        
 
With respect to bundled example applications, the team decided to refactor and include 
the application used in the the SIP UAS Load Tests, allowing users to recreate the 
tests and also see optimal code for applications playing the SIP UAS role.

Also worth of special mention, the Mobicents Media Server and SIP Balancer were also 
updated, to versions 2.1.0.BETA1 and 1.2.FINAL respectively.

Finally, note that additional bundled Mobicents components, are now placed in "extra" 
directory, leaving the "tools" directory just for Mobicents JAIN SLEE tools.

About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
