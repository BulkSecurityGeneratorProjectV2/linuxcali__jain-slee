The Mobicents team is proud to announce the release of
Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.2.0.FINAL, the third major release of the 
second generation Mobicents JAIN-SLEE AS.

Release Notes:

Major enhancements were done in the JAIN SLEE Core:

- Cluster performance optimization, 8x compared with 2.1.2.FINAL
- Support for "Buddy Groups" clusters
- Tracers performance optimization
- Enhanced RA's SleeEndpoint with custom operations to help/optimize
work in cluster mode
- EJB support for SBBs, as defined by JAIN SLEE 1.1 standard
- CMP Field Accessor Methods performance optimization
- SbbContext/ProfileContext JAIN SLEE 1.1 Extension
- ActivityContextInterface JAIN SLEE 1.1 Extension
- Library XML Descriptor References JAIN SLEE 1.1 Extension
 
Several bug fixes, some of critical importance, are also included in 
the JAIN SLEE core.

One of the most important Resource Adaptors in the platform, the JAIN 
SIP RA, was also deeply enhanced, specially on clustering and dialog 
forking. The XCAP Client RA API was also object of an intense analysis, 
and it is now completely independent of Apache HTTP Client.

Now a few surprises, the demand for these is quite strong in the 
community, and we are proud to finally release our Command Line 
Interface, based on Twiddle, the new SMPP v5 Resource Adaptor, and the 
first preview of the new Eclipse SLEE plugin.

The Twiddle Command Line Interface is a new management tools which allows
interaction with the server through shell scripts or quick commands.
 
The SMPP v5 Resource Adaptor is 100% new code, which supports the latest 
SMPP specs version. The RA is also cluster aware, supporting high 
availability and fault tolerance. 
 
The new EclipSLEE plugin takes a radical new direction, we believe that 
such plugin, to be useful, must also be used by the Mobicents developers team. 
The plugin now sets up and manages maven projects similar to the Mobicents RAs 
and Examples, and on top of that it exposes forms to make it easier to add 
or remove components/modules. This is just the beginning, a technology preview, 
providing the foundations for a very high level development tool.

Last but not least, this release also provides the second iteration over 
SS7 technologies, with updated JCC and MAP Resource Adaptors, and for the 
first we provide support for SCCP.

About Mobicents JAIN SLEE:
 
Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. The 
Twiddle CLI, for quick management of the application server. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.
