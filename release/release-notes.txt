The Mobicents team is proud to announce the release of
Mobicents JAIN-SLEE 2.1.0.GA, the first review for the successful
second generation Mobicents JAIN SLEE container, with more than
1500 downloads in about 3 months.

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x is the first and *only* open source JAIN SLEE
1.1 (JSR 240) compliant platform, a low latency and high throughput
application/service environment for event processing, designed for
stringent requirements of core network signaling application, and to
support scalability and availability through clustering.

The environment provides common behavior to all services:
- Managing component life-cycle (install/activate/deactivate/uninstall,=85)
- Generating traces & alarms, managing resources, user statistics;
- Common behavior is not re-developed for each and every service, the
service developer only cares about service logic

Mobicents JAIN SLEE 2.x generation represents a major
step forward, introducing major performance/latency improvements. High
Availability and Fault Tolerance features are included , such as fault
tolerant timers, full application state replication, or the Fault
Tolerant Resource Adaptor API, an easy to use API that JAIN SLEE 1.1
resource adaptors can use to work correctly in a clustered
environement. Flexibility is a keyword in the new platform too, JAIN
SLEE profiles are mapped to JPA data sources, and extensive
configuration options can be used to tweak the platform behavior.

Platform management can be achieved through two different tools: the
JMX web console giving full access to JAIN SLEE 1.1 and custom
Mobicents MBeans; and the new Jopr ( http://www.jboss.org/jopr )
Plugin, which allows the full JBoss and Mobicents platforms to have a
consistent and unified advanced management and monitoring tool. A SNMP
adaptor is also available in the underlying JBoss AS.

Standouts in this concrete release are:
* Better modularized JAIN SLEE core, easy to customize at every level
* Even more throughput and less latency
* Event Router Performance and Load Statistics
* Improved Logging
* Simple global logging configuration through JMX or JOPR
* Congestion Control based on memory usage
* Enhanced Fault Tolerant RA API
* Enhanced SLEE Connection Factory
* JCC Resource Adaptor for SS7 connectivity
* MAP Resource Adaptor for SS7 connectivity
* Converged Demo example application
* Several bug fixes
* Updated bundle, now with Mobicents Media Server 2.0 CR2, Mobicents Diameter 1.2.1
and Mobicents SIP Balancer 1.0 FINAL

Simply extract the content of the binary release zip, make sure there
is no JBOSS_HOME environment variable set (or it is pointing to the
jboss-5.1.0.GA directory extracted) and start the container, through
run.sh/run.bat startup scripts in jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin. More information
regarding the JAIN SLEE Container in the documentation available at
the docs directory. Other documentation, regarding other platform
components, is available in the related component's directory (e.g.
the SIP11 Resource Adaptor documentation in is /resources/sip11/docs)
.
